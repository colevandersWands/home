# Fork & Regenerate

**Fork**: Most of people use fork to get other's projects on their accounts, Which it takes a copy of an entire project with branches, commits and history, And make a copy of it in your account.

**Regenerate**: Same as "Fork" it takes a copy of an entire project but without the history.
